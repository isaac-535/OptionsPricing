<strong>Options Visualisation Tool</strong>

An interactive web app built with Plotly Dash to explore the Blackâ€“Scholes model for option pricing and sensitivities (the Greeks).

This tool allows users to:

- Select an independent variable (e.g. stock price, strike, volatility, interest rate, time).

- Visualise how the option value or chosen Greek changes as that variable varies.

- Switch between call and put options.

- Adjust constant parameters dynamically through input boxes and sliders.

- Read quick explanations of each parameter and Greek via an integrated help panel.

Features:

- Interactive graphs (powered by plotly.express).

- Customisable sliders and inputs for parameter control.

- Styled with a dark theme for readability.

- Clean tab navigation between calls and puts.

- Off-canvas info panel with short definitions of parameters and Greeks.
